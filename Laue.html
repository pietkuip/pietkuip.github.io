<H1>Laue diffraction</H1>

<H4>Orientation of single crystals</H4>

<P>Laue diffraction is most often used for mounting single crystals in a 
precisely known orientation, for example for polishing a surface or for 
doing measurements. When the incoming beam is parallel to a high-symmetry 
direction of the crystal, the Laue pattern also has high symmetry. In 
cubic crystals, an incoming beam parallel to one of the unit cell edges (a 
<001> direction) produces Laue patterns with 4-fold symmetry. An incoming 
parallel to the body diagonal of the unit cell produces a 3-fold 
symmetrical pattern of Laue spots. </P>

<H4>Assigning Laue spots</H4>

<P>In most applications only the symmetry of the Laue pattern is used. In 
this lab we will also assign the Laue spots to the crystal planes that 
give rise to them. We will also determine the wavelength of the Laue beams, 
and check if this is consistent with the high voltage on the x-ray anode.</P>

<P>The figure shows an XZ-plane of a simple cubic crystal. Planes parallel to 
the Y-direction are perpendicular to the plane of the drawing. A 
polychromatic x-ray beam enters the crystal along the Z-direction [001]. 
The beam reflects off the (201) planes, which are perpendicular to the 
[201] direction. Constructive interference of wavelengths that satisfy 
the Bragg condition will give rise to the 
indicated Laue beam, which produces a spot on the film.</P>

<P>The direction of this beam is found by geometry - it does not depend on 
the lattice constant. The glancing angle of the incoming beam 
with the reflecting set of 
planes is given by the inner product of the normalized direction 
vectors:</P>

<P>As indicated in the figure, this gives that the angles of the diffracting 
(201) planes and the incoming and transmitted beam are both equal to 
26.6&deg;. Also the angle of reflection must be equal to the angle of 
incidence. Taken together, we find an angle of 53.2&deg; between the Laue 
beam and the x-rays that go straight through the crystal.</P>

    <P>The wavelength of a diffracted beam needs to satisfy the Bragg condition. 
    The grazing angle of incidence is given by formula(1), in our case 
    26.6&deg;. The distance between the planes is calculated from the indices 
    assigned to a Laue beam and the lattice parameter of the cubic crystal:</P>

    <P>Steffen Weber's <A HREF="http://jcrystal.com/steffenweber/JAVA/jlaue/jlaue.html">Laue 
applet</A> gives both these numbers when you click on a spot. Unfortunately, the applet cuts off att 25&deg;, so that 201=402=603 and equivalent spots are just outside the applet's "film area".</P>
